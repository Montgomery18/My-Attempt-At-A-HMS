## My Attempt at a Hospital Management System
Made with c# window forms in visual studio with the database being made in sqlite using db browser. The NuGet package System.Data.SQLite is used for connecting the database to the program.

All data in the database is made up.

## Assembling It
When you assemble the program make sure the database and the images in the folder "Database and Password Strength Images" are put beside the .exe (usually in the bin\Debug(or release)\net6.0-windows if using visual studio)

## Design
There is a picture of a use case diagram and entity relationship diagram in the folder "Design Diagrams" that were created for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the program.
